    This is another simple and fun from scratch website I created for CS 260 at Brigham Young University.
    This features some simple Javascript to call a Random Number Generator API, and I used it as a functional Dungeons and Dragons Dice Roller.
    I hosted this as a website from my home network for quite some time because it was surprisingly useful.
